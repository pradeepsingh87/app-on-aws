This example diagram demonstrates the ability of AWS CDK to deploy cloud infrastructure into the AWS Cloud. A developer interacts with AWS CDK and its three main components (App, Stack, and Construct) to synthesize an AWS CloudFormation template, then deploy AWS resources for their organization's users. In this example, the developer created a Well-Architected solution containing an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS).
