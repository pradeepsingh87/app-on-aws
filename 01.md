### What does AWS CDK do?

Compiling your source code into an assembly language is a common code-development process. Think of` AWS CDK as a compiler` that `compiles your source code` into an `AWS CloudFormation template` .

This example diagram demonstrates the ability of AWS CDK to deploy cloud infrastructure into the AWS Cloud. A developer interacts with AWS CDK and its three main components (App, Stack, and Construct) to synthesize an AWS CloudFormation template, then deploy AWS resources for their organization's users. In this example, the developer created a Well-Architected solution containing an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS).


### Core framework of AWS CDK

#### Constructs
Constructs are the basic building blocks of AWS CDK apps. A construct represents a cloud component and encapsulates everything that AWS CloudFormation needs to create the component. A construct can represent a single cloud resource (such as an AWS Lambda function), or it can represent a higher-level component consisting of multiple AWS CDK resources.

AWS CDK includes the AWS Construct Library, which contains constructs representing Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources. This library includes constructs that represent all the resources available on AWS.

#### Stacks
Stacks are a unit of deployment in AWS CDK. All AWS resources defined within the scope of a stack, directly or indirectly, are provisioned as a single unit. Because AWS CDK stacks are implemented through AWS CloudFormation stacks, they have the same limitations. You can define any number of stacks in an AWS CDK app.

#### Apps
Your CDK application is an app, and is represented by the AWS CDK App class. To provision infrastructure resources, all constructs that represent AWS resources must be defined, directly or indirectly, within the scope of a stack construct.


### Importance of AWS CDK for your organization
- Workflow : With AWS CDK, you can use your organization’s existing code review processes for building cloud infrastructure
- Reuse your infrastructure as a library : With AWS CDK, you can design your own reusable components that meet your organization’s security, compliance, and governance requirements. 

### Advantages of using AWS CDK
- Achieving faster deployment by using expressive programming languages for defining infrastructure
- Incorporating features such as objects, loops, and conditions to improve the ease with which you can define your infrastructure
- Staying in your integrated development environment (IDE)
- Writing your runtime code and defining your AWS resources with the same programming language .

Additional benefits 
- Use logic (IF statements, for-loops) when defining your infrastructure.
- Use object-oriented techniques to create a model of your system.
- Define high-level abstractions, share them, and publish them to your team, company, or community.
- Organize your project into logical modules.
- Share and reuse your infrastructure as a library.
- Test your infrastructure code using open-standard protocols.
- Use your existing code review workflow.
- Complete code within your IDE.
