### How AWS CDK interacts with supported programming language

AWS builds the business logic of AWS Construct Library packages in TypeScript, and uses AWS JSii to provide mappings to each supported programming language.
This mapping ensures that the AWS CDK construct process is consistent across languages. AWS can then offer a comprehensive set of construct packages that are available in all languages. The code you write in your AWS CDK project is built in the programming language you prefer, and the compiled JavaScript runtime is an implementation of your code.
